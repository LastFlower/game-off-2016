## Abort the Code and Tools

This game is based on HTML5 technologies.
Unlike HTML5 canvas games, this game is largely based on SVG and simple DOM animations,
so that it could work without any game framework.

The original SVG graphics is done with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
Sound effects is done with [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) and [GeneralUser GS](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php).

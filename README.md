## About the Code and Tools

This game is based on HTML5 technologies.
Unlike HTML5 canvas games, this game is largely based on SVG and simple DOM animations,
so that it can work without any game framework.

Some SVG graphics is done with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
Sound effects is done with [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) and [GeneralUser GS](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php).
